From here there are two different routes, based on your operating system

navigate to the project structure of your IDE. From here navigat to (local) libraries. In here you want to add the processing library. 
There is a specific path to get the wnated file:

(You might need to double click the app icon for processing in your finder, to access the files)

### windows
